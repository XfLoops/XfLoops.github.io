Naming a variable or structuring a commit message is usually a brain-racking task to me. To make it efficient and effective, I introduced a rigid commit message format by [JEREMY MACK](http://t.cn/R5wFoN9) to help me become a better programmer.

So a message appears in this way:

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.

```
+	feat (new feature)
+	fix (bug fix)
+	docs (changes to documentation)
+	style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
+	refactor (refactoring production code)
+	test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
+	chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

END
