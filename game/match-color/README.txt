I'm very happy with this game, i learned a lot of news things. I want to make more simples games like this to learn more. 

I spend some more time making this game than the [another one](http://codepen.io/EduardoLopes/pen/IJnAr), i needed to figure out how to make a pathfinder, and before i spent a lot of time trying to do by 'brutal force'. I think was 3 days making this game.

Enjoy. :D
