Food Security Explorer (FSE)
===========================

### What is this?
[FSE](http://xflcoder.cn/demo/) is a multidimensional explorer of food security data from [FAO](http://faostat3.fao.org/).
The [parallel coordinates](https://eagereyes.org/techniques/parallel-coordinates) displays a suite of food security indicators in the database across *18 dimensions*, colored by country group.

### How to use this?
Put the file under ***a web server root category***，then use a html5 supported browser to visit it. See? Great! 

It’s easy to operate on the FSE!

- Remove Brush: Tap the axis background.
- Reorder Axes: Drag a label horizontally.
- Invert Axis: Tap an axis label.
- Remove Axis: Drag axis label to the left edge.
